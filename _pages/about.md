I'm a PhD candidate at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://people.epfl.ch/song.chen). My research interest includes chemical probe design, signaling pathway investigation and drug development.

I was advised by [Prof. Bin Tan](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/english-bin-tan.html) and [Prof. Shaoyu Li](https://yyhg.tzc.edu.cn/info/1095/5900.htm) at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) from 2019 to 2022. After that, I was fortunate to get the PhD position to study chemical biology at EPFL.
